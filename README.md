## Contributions

To make contributions please fork the repo so that you have your own copy to modify.

Then make a branch with the name of the changes/additions that you have.

Work in the branch making commits to checkpoint your work and once finished and satified you can make a pull request.

We can then review it and make sure it works (or at least compiles).
